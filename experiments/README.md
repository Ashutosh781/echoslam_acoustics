## Results

`pipe_trial2.py` creates a basic cuboidal 15m long 'pipe' with acoustically reflective surfaces at both ends. For the following impulse response, the source and mic where kept at x=13m.

This matches with the Fig 2 in this paper. The few additional peaks at the beginning probably correspond to reflections from the side of the pipe.
